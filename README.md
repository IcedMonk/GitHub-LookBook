Mark Zuckerbug in Harvard’s batch of 2017 commencement speech said “Let’s do big things not just to create progress but to create purpose.” He emphasised on the need to build communities and the need to come together and achieve things that we couldn’t on our own. Be it through Facebook and how it connects tribes to cities to nations. Or LinkedIn - the window to the corporate world. We accomplish more when we meet new people, and I believe in the same. GitHub, a home for the code-blooded, facilitates social coding by providing a web interface to the Git Repository and management tools for collaboration. GitHub can be thought as a similar social networking site for software developers. It provides you a platform to share and store your projects and work with like minded people. I have been contributing to this platform since the very first year of my graduation and day by day have honed my skills assiduously. After 365 days of learning, growing and exploring I have come up with GitHub LookBook - a product of this journey.
